# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
Mod 19
##The purpose of this analysis is well defined
- 
##Data Preprocessing
- What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
- What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
- What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
##Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
- What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
##ummary of the results (2 pt)
T- here is a recommendation on using a different model to solve the classification problem, and justification
